![Cargo Logo](images/Cargo-Logo-Small.png)

Cargo is the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) [*package manager*](./appendix/glossary.html#package-manager "\"package manager\" (glossary entry)"). Cargo downloads your Rust [package](./appendix/glossary.html#package "\"package\" (glossary entry)")âs
dependencies, compiles your packages, makes distributable packages, and uploads them to
[crates.io](https://crates.io/), the Rust communityâs [*package registry*](./appendix/glossary.html#package-registry "\"package registry\" (glossary entry)"). You can contribute
to this book on [GitHub](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/tree/master/src/doc).
