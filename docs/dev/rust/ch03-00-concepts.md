# The Rust Programming Language

# [Common Programming Concepts](#common-programming-concepts)

This chapter covers concepts that appear in almost every programming language
and how they work in Rust. Many programming languages have much in common at
their core. None of the concepts presented in this chapter are unique to Rust,
but weâll discuss them in the context of Rust and explain the conventions
around using these concepts.

Specifically, youâll learn about variables, basic types, functions, comments,
and control flow. These foundations will be in every Rust program, and learning
them early will give you a strong core to start from.

#### [Keywords](#keywords)

The Rust language has a set of *keywords* that are reserved for use by the
language only, much as in other languages. Keep in mind that you cannot use
these words as names of variables or functions. Most of the keywords have
special meanings, and youâll be using them to do various tasks in your Rust
programs; a few have no current functionality associated with them but have
been reserved for functionality that might be added to Rust in the future. You
can find a list of the keywords in [Appendix A](appendix-01-keywords.html).
