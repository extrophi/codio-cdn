# The Rust Programming Language

# [Understanding Ownership](#understanding-ownership)

Ownership is Rustâs most unique feature and has deep implications for the rest
of the language. It enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without
needing a garbage collector, so itâs important to understand how ownership
works. In this chapter, weâll talk about ownership as well as several related
features: borrowing, slices, and how Rust lays data out in memory.
