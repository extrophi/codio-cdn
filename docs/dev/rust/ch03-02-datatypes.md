# The Rust Programming Language

## [Data Types](#data-types)

Every value in Rust is of a certain *data type*, which tells Rust what kind of
data is being specified so it knows how to work with that data. Weâll look at
two data type subsets: scalar and compound.

Keep in mind that Rust is a *statically typed* language, which means that it
must know the types of all variables at compile time. The compiler can usually
infer what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it. In cases
when many types are possible, such as when we converted a `String` to a numeric
type using `parse` in the [âComparing the Guess to the Secret
Numberâ](ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#comparing-the-guess-to-the-secret-number) section in
Chapter 2, we must add a type annotation, like this:

```
```
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
let guess: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
}
```
```

If we donât add the `: u32` type annotation shown in the preceding code, Rust
will display the following error, which means the compiler needs more
information from us to know which type we want to use:

```
$ cargo build

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0284`.

```

Youâll see different type annotations for other data types.

### [Scalar Types](#scalar-types)

A *scalar* type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types:
integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters. You may recognize
these from other programming languages. Letâs jump into how they work in Rust.

#### [Integer Types](#integer-types)

An *integer* is a number without a fractional component. We used one integer
type in Chapter 2, the `u32` type. This type declaration indicates that the
value itâs associated with should be an unsigned integer (signed integer types
start with `i` instead of `u`) that takes up 32 bits of space. Table 3-1 shows
the built-in integer types in Rust. We can use any of these variants to declare
the type of an integer value.

Table 3-1: Integer Types in Rust

| Length | Signed | Unsigned |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 8-bit | `i8` | `u8` |
| 16-bit | `i16` | `u16` |
| 32-bit | `i32` | `u32` |
| 64-bit | `i64` | `u64` |
| 128-bit | `i128` | `u128` |
| architecture dependent | `isize` | `usize` |

Each variant can be either signed or unsigned and has an explicit size.
*Signed* and *unsigned* refer to whether itâs possible for the number to be
negativeâin other words, whether the number needs to have a sign with it
(signed) or whether it will only ever be positive and can therefore be
represented without a sign (unsigned). Itâs like writing numbers on paper: when
the sign matters, a number is shown with a plus sign or a minus sign; however,
when itâs safe to assume the number is positive, itâs shown with no sign.
Signed numbers are stored using [twoâs complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement) representation.

Each signed variant can store numbers from â(2n â 1) to 2n â
1 â 1 inclusive, where *n* is the number of bits that variant uses. So an
`i8` can store numbers from â(27) to 27 â 1, which equals
â128 to 127. Unsigned variants can store numbers from 0 to 2n â 1,
so a `u8` can store numbers from 0 to 28 â 1, which equals 0 to 255.

Additionally, the `isize` and `usize` types depend on the architecture of the
computer your program is running on: 64 bits if youâre on a 64-bit architecture
and 32 bits if youâre on a 32-bit architecture.

You can write integer literals in any of the forms shown in Table 3-2. Note
that number literals that can be multiple numeric types allow a type suffix,
such as `57u8`, to designate the type. Number literals can also use `_` as a
visual separator to make the number easier to read, such as `1_000`, which will
have the same value as if you had specified `1000`.

Table 3-2: Integer Literals in Rust

| Number literals | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Decimal | `98_222` |
| Hex | `0xff` |
| Octal | `0o77` |
| Binary | `0b1111_0000` |
| Byte (`u8` only) | `b'A'` |

So how do you know which type of integer to use? If youâre unsure, Rustâs
defaults are generally good places to start: integer types default to `i32`.
The primary situation in which youâd use `isize` or `usize` is when indexing
some sort of collection.

##### [Integer Overflow](#integer-overflow)

Letâs say you have a variable of type `u8` that can hold values between 0 and
255. If you try to change the variable to a value outside that range, such as
256, *integer overflow* will occur, which can result in one of two behaviors.
When youâre compiling in debug mode, Rust includes checks for integer overflow
that cause your program to *panic* at runtime if this behavior occurs. Rust
uses the term *panicking* when a program exits with an error; weâll discuss
panics in more depth in the [âUnrecoverable Errors with
`panic!`â](ch09-01-unrecoverable-errors-with-panic.html) section in Chapter
9.

When youâre compiling in release mode with the `--release` flag, Rust does
*not* include checks for integer overflow that cause panics. Instead, if
overflow occurs, Rust performs *twoâs complement wrapping*. In short, values
greater than the maximum value the type can hold âwrap aroundâ to the minimum
of the values the type can hold. In the case of a `u8`, the value 256 becomes
0, the value 257 becomes 1, and so on. The program wonât panic, but the
variable will have a value that probably isnât what you were expecting it to
have. Relying on integer overflowâs wrapping behavior is considered an error.

To explicitly handle the possibility of overflow, you can use these families
of methods provided by the standard library for primitive numeric types:

* Wrap in all modes with the `wrapping_*` methods, such as `wrapping_add`.
* Return the `None` value if there is overflow with the `checked_*` methods.
* Return the value and a Boolean indicating whether there was overflow with
  the `overflowing_*` methods.
* Saturate at the valueâs minimum or maximum values with the `saturating_*`
  methods.

#### [Floating-Point Types](#floating-point-types)

Rust also has two primitive types for *floating-point numbers*, which are
numbers with decimal points. Rustâs floating-point types are `f32` and `f64`,
which are 32 bits and 64 bits in size, respectively. The default type is `f64`
because on modern CPUs, itâs roughly the same speed as `f32` but is capable of
more precision. All floating-point types are signed.

Hereâs an example that shows floating-point numbers in action:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
```
fn main() {
    let x = 2.0; // f64

    let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}
```
```

Floating-point numbers are represented according to the IEEE-754 standard.

#### [Numeric Operations](#numeric-operations)

Rust supports the basic mathematical operations youâd expect for all the number
types: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder. Integer
division truncates toward zero to the nearest integer. The following code shows
how youâd use each numeric operation in a `let` statement:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
```
fn main() {
    // addition
    let sum = 5 + 10;

    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;

    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;

    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;
    let truncated = -5 / 3; // Results in -1

    // remainder
    let remainder = 43 % 5;
}
```
```

Each expression in these statements uses a mathematical operator and evaluates
to a single value, which is then bound to a variable. [Appendix
B](appendix-02-operators.html) contains a list of all operators that Rust
provides.

#### [The Boolean Type](#the-boolean-type)

As in most other programming languages, a Boolean type in Rust has two possible
values: `true` and `false`. Booleans are one byte in size. The Boolean type in
Rust is specified using `bool`. For example:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
```
fn main() {
    let t = true;

    let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
}
```
```

The main way to use Boolean values is through conditionals, such as an `if`
expression. Weâll cover how `if` expressions work in Rust in the [âControl
Flowâ](ch03-05-control-flow.html#control-flow) section.

#### [The Character Type](#the-character-type)

Rustâs `char` type is the languageâs most primitive alphabetic type. Here are
some examples of declaring `char` values:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
```
fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z: char = 'â¤'; // with explicit type annotation
    let heart_eyed_cat = 'ð»';
}
```
```

Note that we specify `char` literals with single quotes, as opposed to string
literals, which use double quotes. Rustâs `char` type is four bytes in size and
represents a Unicode scalar value, which means it can represent a lot more than
just ASCII. Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji;
and zero-width spaces are all valid `char` values in Rust. Unicode scalar
values range from `U+0000` to `U+D7FF` and `U+E000` to `U+10FFFF` inclusive.
However, a âcharacterâ isnât really a concept in Unicode, so your human
intuition for what a âcharacterâ is may not match up with what a `char` is in
Rust. Weâll discuss this topic in detail in [âStoring UTF-8 Encoded Text with
Stringsâ](ch08-02-strings.html#storing-utf-8-encoded-text-with-strings) in Chapter 8.

### [Compound Types](#compound-types)

*Compound types* can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two
primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.

#### [The Tuple Type](#the-tuple-type)

A *tuple* is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a
variety of types into one compound type. Tuples have a fixed length: once
declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.

We create a tuple by writing a comma-separated list of values inside
parentheses. Each position in the tuple has a type, and the types of the
different values in the tuple donât have to be the same. Weâve added optional
type annotations in this example:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
```
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}
```
```

The variable `tup` binds to the entire tuple because a tuple is considered a
single compound element. To get the individual values out of a tuple, we can
use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value, like this:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
```
fn main() {
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let (x, y, z) = tup;

    println!("The value of y is: {y}");
}
```
```

This program first creates a tuple and binds it to the variable `tup`. It then
uses a pattern with `let` to take `tup` and turn it into three separate
variables, `x`, `y`, and `z`. This is called *destructuring* because it breaks
the single tuple into three parts. Finally, the program prints the value of
`y`, which is `6.4`.

We can also access a tuple element directly by using a period (`.`) followed by
the index of the value we want to access. For example:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
```
fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let five_hundred = x.0;

    let six_point_four = x.1;

    let one = x.2;
}
```
```

This program creates the tuple `x` and then accesses each element of the tuple
using their respective indices. As with most programming languages, the first
index in a tuple is 0.

The tuple without any values has a special name, *unit*. This value and its
corresponding type are both written `()` and represent an empty value or an
empty return type. Expressions implicitly return the unit value if they donât
return any other value.

#### [The Array Type](#the-array-type)

Another way to have a collection of multiple values is with an *array*. Unlike
a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type. Unlike arrays in
some other languages, arrays in Rust have a fixed length.

We write the values in an array as a comma-separated list inside square
brackets:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
```
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}
```
```

Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack, the same as
the other types we have seen so far, rather than the heap (we will discuss the
stack and the heap more in [Chapter 4](ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#the-stack-and-the-heap)) or when
you want to ensure you always have a fixed number of elements. An array isnât
as flexible as the vector type, though. A *vector* is a similar collection type
provided by the standard library that *is* allowed to grow or shrink in size
because its contents live on the heap. If youâre unsure whether to use an array
or a vector, chances are you should use a vector. [Chapter 8](ch08-01-vectors.html) discusses vectors in more detail.

However, arrays are more useful when you know the number of elements will not
need to change. For example, if you were using the names of the month in a
program, you would probably use an array rather than a vector because you know
it will always contain 12 elements:

```
```
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
let months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July",
              "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"];
}
```
```

You write an arrayâs type using square brackets with the type of each element,
a semicolon, and then the number of elements in the array, like so:

```
```
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}
```
```

Here, `i32` is the type of each element. After the semicolon, the number `5`
indicates the array contains five elements.

You can also initialize an array to contain the same value for each element by
specifying the initial value, followed by a semicolon, and then the length of
the array in square brackets, as shown here:

```
```
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
let a = [3; 5];
}
```
```

The array named `a` will contain `5` elements that will all be set to the value
`3` initially. This is the same as writing `let a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3];` but in a
more concise way.

##### [Accessing Array Elements](#accessing-array-elements)

An array is a single chunk of memory of a known, fixed size that can be
allocated on the stack. You can access elements of an array using indexing,
like this:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
```
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let first = a[0];
    let second = a[1];
}
```
```

In this example, the variable named `first` will get the value `1` because that
is the value at index `[0]` in the array. The variable named `second` will get
the value `2` from index `[1]` in the array.

##### [Invalid Array Element Access](#invalid-array-element-access)

Letâs see what happens if you try to access an element of an array that is past
the end of the array. Say you run this code, similar to the guessing game in
Chapter 2, to get an array index from the user:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
use std::io;

fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    println!("Please enter an array index.");

    let mut index = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut index)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    let index: usize = index
        .trim()
        .parse()
        .expect("Index entered was not a number");

    let element = a[index];

    println!("The value of the element at index {index} is: {element}");
}
```

This code compiles successfully. If you run this code using `cargo run` and
enter `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, or `4`, the program will print out the corresponding
value at that index in the array. If you instead enter a number past the end of
the array, such as `10`, youâll see output like this:

```
thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:19:19:
index out of bounds: the len is 5 but the index is 10
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

The program resulted in a *runtime* error at the point of using an invalid
value in the indexing operation. The program exited with an error message and
didnât execute the final `println!` statement. When you attempt to access an
element using indexing, Rust will check that the index youâve specified is less
than the array length. If the index is greater than or equal to the length,
Rust will panic. This check has to happen at runtime, especially in this case,
because the compiler canât possibly know what value a user will enter when they
run the code later.

This is an example of Rustâs memory safety principles in action. In many
low-level languages, this kind of check is not done, and when you provide an
incorrect index, invalid memory can be accessed. Rust protects you against this
kind of error by immediately exiting instead of allowing the memory access and
continuing. Chapter 9 discusses more of Rustâs error handling and how you can
write readable, safe code that neither panics nor allows invalid memory access.
