## 🌟 Key Insights

This library reveals:

1. **Knowledge is cumulative** — Each generation builds on giants' shoulders
2. **Paradigm shifts are real** — Revolutions (quantum, relativity, DNA, AI) reshape understanding
3. **No monopoly on wisdom** — Greek, Indian, Chinese, Islamic traditions all contributed
4. **Abstraction = power** — Mathematics, logic, information theory enable prediction
5. **Tools extend mind** — Each instrument (telescope, microscope, AI) reveals new realities
6. **Limits exist** — Gödel, Heisenberg, Turing showed fundamental boundaries
7. **Democratization continues** — Writing → printing → internet → AI democratizes knowledge
8. **Mysteries remain** — Consciousness, quantum gravity, dark matter, P vs NP unsolved
